# Troubleshooting, diagnostics & upgrading

## `cs doctor` — self-diagnostic

If the status bar isn't behaving the way you expect, run:

```bash
cs doctor
```

It prints (with red ✗ for anything off):

- Which `cs` binary the OS will resolve, plus its version + Python interpreter
- Whether `~/.claude/settings.json` has *our* statusLine entry (vs missing / vs another tool's)
- How fresh `~/.cache/claude-statusbar/last_stdin.json` is (so you can tell if Claude Code is actually pushing data)
- If the daemon is running (fast mode) — its pid and how stale `rendered.ansi` is
- Terminal size and `TERM`
- Current resolved `style` / `theme` / all `show_*` toggles
- Slash commands installed under `~/.claude/commands/`

Paste the output verbatim in any bug report — it's almost always enough to diagnose remotely.

## Common problems

**Status line doesn't appear after install** — Restart Claude Code (settings.json is read at session start). If still missing, run `cs doctor` and check the `statusLine entry` row.

**`cs doctor` says "missing"** — A Claude Code upgrade can wipe `statusLine` from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Run `cs --setup` (or `cs --setup --fast` if you want daemon mode) to restore it. The package also self-heals once per day automatically.

**Numbers stuck / not updating** — Two possibilities:
1. `refreshInterval` not set — Claude Code only re-renders on activity. Add `"refreshInterval": 30` (or `1` for live cache-age).
2. Daemon mode running stale data — `cs daemon stop && cs daemon start`. Or just `cs doctor` and check `daemon` row freshness.

**Cache-age segment shows `cache 0s` and never moves** — `refreshInterval` is unset; Claude Code only re-invokes the statusLine on each user/assistant turn. Set `"refreshInterval": 1` in settings.json. For 1Hz refresh you'll also want `cs --setup --fast` so the per-second invocation stays cheap.

**`cs --setup --fast` then daemon shows wrong rate-limits** — Fixed in v3.2.1. Upgrade with `cs upgrade`.

**Auto-update is annoying / blocked** — `export CLAUDE_STATUSBAR_NO_UPDATE=1` in your shell rc.

For anything else: open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/leeguooooo/claude-code-usage-bar/issues) with the output of `cs doctor` attached — it captures version, paths, settings.json state, daemon state, and recent cache freshness in one paste.

## Upgrading

Auto-updates once per day from PyPI. To upgrade manually, one command works for
every install (pip, pipx, or uv — it detects which one is actually running `cs`
and uses that, so you never need to know or guess):

```bash
cs upgrade
```

Don't reach for `uv tool install`/`pipx upgrade` by hand — if you installed via
`pip`, you may not even have those tools, and running the wrong one can leave
you with two parallel installs. `cs upgrade` picks the right channel for you.

To disable auto-updates: `export CLAUDE_STATUSBAR_NO_UPDATE=1`
