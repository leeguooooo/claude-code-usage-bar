## Thread (1/6)

```
The problem: Claude's web UI doesn't show real-time token usage.

You code happily, then suddenly... "Rate limit exceeded" 😱

No warning. No heads up. Just... stopped.
```

## Thread (2/6)

```
The solution: A lightweight status bar that shows:

🔋 Tokens used vs limit
💰 Current cost in USD  
⏱️ Time until reset
📊 Usage percentage with color coding

All updating in real-time as you type.
```

Installation is literally one command.

It auto-detects your system, installs the package, configures Claude Code, and sets up shell aliases.

No manual configuration. No editing config files. It just works.

## Thread (4/6)

Works everywhere:
✅ Claude Code status bar
✅ Terminal (just type 'cs')
✅ tmux status line
✅ zsh/bash prompts
✅ Any script that needs usage data

Color coded:
🟢 < 30% used
🟡 30-70% used
🔴 > 70% used
```

I built a status bar that shows real-time token usage.
