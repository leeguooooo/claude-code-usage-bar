**标题：** How do you track your Claude token usage?

**内容：**
```
I've been using Claude for coding lately and keep hitting the rate limit unexpectedly. The web interface doesn't show real-time usage which is frustrating.

Currently I have to manually check the usage page, but by then it's usually too late.

How do you all handle this? Any tips or workflows that help?

I ended up writing a small Python script for myself to check usage in the terminal, but curious what everyone else does.

**标题：** Made a terminal widget to track Claude usage - would love feedback

**内容：**
```
Hey everyone,

Like many here, I was constantly surprised by hitting Claude's rate limits. The lack of real-time usage info was driving me crazy during long coding sessions.

So I spent the weekend building a simple terminal status bar that shows:
- Current token count
- How much I've spent
- Time until reset
- Color changes as usage increases

It's just a Python script that reads the usage data and formats it nicely. Nothing fancy but it's been super helpful for me.

Using it with tmux now and finally I can see when I'm getting close to the limit.

Would love to hear if others have this problem too? What features would be useful?

Happy to clean it up and share the code if there's interest.

## 版本3：故事型（最自然）

**标题：** Finally solved my Claude rate limit frustration

**内容：**
```
Story time: Yesterday I was deep in a debugging session with Claude, making great progress, and then... boom. Rate limit hit. No warning, just dead stop.

This has happened so many times. The web UI gives no heads up about approaching limits.

So I got frustrated enough to do something about it. Wrote a quick Python script that shows my usage in the terminal. Super simple - just tokens, cost, and time left.

The best part? I added colors. Green when I'm safe, yellow when getting close, red when I should slow down.

Now I keep it running in tmux and actually know when to take a break.

Anyone else dealt with this? How do you manage your token usage?

Sure! I put it up on GitHub. It's pretty basic but does the job.

You can find it at: leeguooooo/claude-code-usage-bar

Still rough around the edges but I made it easy to install. Let me know if you try it!

### 第二层回复（有人问如何安装）
```
I tried to make it super simple - you can install it with pip:
pip install claude-statusbar

Or if you want the one-liner that sets everything up:
Check the README on the GitHub page, it has all the details.

Happy to help if you run into any issues!
