# Contribution to Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor

## Message to @Maciek-roboblog

Hi! I've created a lightweight status bar extension based on your excellent Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor project.

### What I Built
- **claude-statusbar**: A minimal status bar display for Claude AI token usage
- **PyPI Package**: Available at https://pypi.org/project/claude-statusbar/
- **One-line installer**: Auto-configures everything including Claude Code integration
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/leeguooooo/claude-code-usage-bar

### Key Features
- Leverages your `claude-monitor` package for accurate data
- Adds status bar integration for Claude Code
- Simplified installation experience
- Maintains full attribution to your original work

### How It Works
1. Uses your `claude-monitor` as a dependency for data analysis
2. Provides a lightweight display layer
3. Auto-configures Claude Code's status bar

### Attribution
- README clearly states it's built on your project
- Links back to your repository
- Recommends installing your package for full functionality

Would love to:
1. Add this as a "Related Project" in your README if you're interested
2. Contribute any improvements back to the main project
3. Collaborate on future features

Thank you for creating such a great foundation to build upon!

Best regards,
@leeguooooo
